# Movie Data Analysis and Visualization

### Project Overview

Film industry has existed since a long time ago. The data that we have for each movie is extremely tremendous. Data analyst could use this to give insights for show-directors in order to make a new movie such as a movie based on people's desire for specific genre and how to succeed on making a high revenue movies.

### Problem Statement / Metrics

This project just overviews how to clean and wrangle dataset. Then do some data explorations using graphs generated from matplotlib or seaborn library.

### Results Summary

Finally we get our result, this genres is most popular from year to year. We see that the best genre year to year is circulated on Drama or Comedy. This pattern does not change with the course of time based on the data. Hence, based on this result, show-directors could try their luck on Drama or Comedy genre because people like them much more.
Based on the result previously, movies with high revenue is movies with high budget also. We could also say that movies with high revenue typically have a longer time than low revenue, it is in average 100 mins. Lastly, high revenue movie is slightly higher on its vote average than low revenue. However, this doesn't take into account the number of voters.

### Limitations

From this dataset, I would say that I am satisfied with the data that has been provided since there's only some missing values from movies. I think the provider of the data really paid attention to the genre column. Hence, I can say that this data is sufficient with this conclusion.
However, this result may not entirely be true since there's a lot of 0 revenue movies in the data. The method to process those data will surely affect the result of this conclusion. Still, viewers can interpret this findings to their own knowledge.
